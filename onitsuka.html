            <h2>History of Onitsuka</h2>
            <p>Onitsuka Tiger, the precursor to ASICS, was founded in 1949 by Kihachiro Onitsuka in Kobe, Japan, initially focusing on basketball shoes to promote health among youth. In the 1950s, the brand expanded its lineup to include footwear for various sports, gaining international recognition when its shoes were worn by athletes at the 1960 Rome Olympics, notably by marathon runner Abebe Bikila. The 1970s saw Onitsuka Tiger rise in popularity in the U.S., becoming part of the emerging sneaker culture. In 1977, the company merged with two others to form ASICS, keeping the Onitsuka Tiger name as a heritage line. Since then, the brand has maintained its legacy while embracing modern sneaker culture, collaborating with designers and releasing limited editions that blend athletic heritage with contemporary style, making it a beloved name in both sports and streetwear today.</p>
