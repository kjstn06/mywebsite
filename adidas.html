            <h2>History of Adidas</h2>
            <p>Adidas has a storied history that began in the early 20th century when Adolf Dassler started making sports shoes in his mother's laundry room after World War I. In 1924, he and his brother Rudolf founded the Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory, gaining fame when Jesse Owens wore their shoes at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Following a split in 1949, Adolf rebranded his company as Adidas, derived from his name. The brand became known for its innovative designs, such as the iconic three-stripe logo, and gained further recognition with the 1970 FIFA World Cup ball. In the 1980s, Adidas embraced lifestyle and fashion, becoming a staple in hip-hop culture through collaborations with artists like Run-D.M.C. The company continued to expand in the 1990s and 2000s, acquiring Reebok and focusing on technology and sustainability. Today, Adidas remains a leader in sportswear and lifestyle apparel, committed to performance, innovation, and sustainability while maintaining strong ties to sports. </p>
