            <h2>History of Nike</h2>
            <p>Nike's history began in 1964 when Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman founded the company as "Blue Ribbon Sports," initially distributing shoes for Japanese brand Onitsuka Tiger. In 1971, the company rebranded as Nike, named after the Greek goddess of victory, and introduced the iconic Swoosh logo. The launch of its first footwear line at the 1972 U.S. Track and Field Trials marked the start of rapid growth, fueled by innovative products like the Nike Cortez and Waffle Trainer. The 1980s saw Nike revolutionize sports marketing by signing high-profile athletes like Michael Jordan and launching the "Just Do It" campaign. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, the brand expanded globally, diversifying its product range while addressing labor practices and embracing technology with initiatives like Nike+. In the 2010s, sustainability became a key focus, and Nike continued to innovate with products such as Flyknit and self-lacing shoes. Today, Nike remains a leading sportswear brand, committed to inclusivity, innovation, and social responsibility.</p>
